This is the latest and improved version of meroshare IPO filler. Basically it fills the IPO,
only the Ordinary Shares for the list of users that you enter the credentials for in the
users.json.

If you want to run the program for yourself, fill in the credentials i.e. dpid, username,
password, ... in the users.json file. Then make sure you have google chrome and Python installed
in your PC. After that install the requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and
run the program.

In the future updates, I will make this program more robust to errors, bring in interactions
through command lines and such. But for now, I'm very happy with the progress and the amount
of robustness it has for general Ordinary share filling.
